# Life_Expectancy_Model
_ This project develops a machine learning model to predict life expectancy using a Random Forest Regressor.  
- It utilizes a dataset containing various socioeconomic and health indicators as features, such as GDP, healthcare expenditure, education levels, and disease prevalence. The model is trained to learn the complex relationships between these factors and life expectancy.  After training, the model can be used to predict life expectancy for new sets of input data.  
- The project includes scripts for training the model, making predictions, and evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics. 
- The Random Forest Regressor is chosen for its ability to handle complex data and prevent overfitting, leading to robust and accurate predictions of life expectancy.
